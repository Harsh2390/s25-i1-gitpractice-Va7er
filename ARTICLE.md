## ["The Tools of a Blind Programmer"] (https://www.parhamdoustdar.com/2016/04/03/tools-of-blind-programmer/)

The article I picked for this assignment is "The Tools of a Blind Programmer". I chose to write about this article as is it presents a completely different view on software engineering, specifically it shows how a blind software engineer goes by his work and what challenges he needs to overcome. His main tool is the screen reader which he uses to read the screen, control the mouse with, hierarchically view the contents on the screen, inspect different types of elements on web pages, etc. The author also talks about the programming languages, IDEs and OSs he uses in his everyday life. Additionally, he mentions the productivity tools he tries to use, which heavily use visualization, and how he overocomes the challenges of understanding those visualizations. 
It is interesting to see how a blind programmer carves their own path and uses the same technology that everyone else uses, but with his own methods. Understanding how he operates with no visual cues can even be helpful to programmers that can see, as often he would try to find the most straightforward shortcuts.
